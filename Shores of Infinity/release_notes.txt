v0.1b

**************************
*** Release Highlights ***
**************************

The global scale of the universe has been increased based on dolynick's outstanding work with DOF.
Movement has been rebalanced to achieve a more realistic feel and, combined with a reduction in population growth and a serious dent in budget due to longer colony ship travel time,
make expansion more system-centric and less of a colony-spam.
Resources and economy have been rebalanced to support these changes in a way that gameplay progression still feels dynamic and rewarding. Some existing buildings and orbitals have been modified, and new ones have been added, to boost economy where needed (including budget). New synergies allow to take advantage of the environment or of the presence of other infrastructure.
This new balance is also designed to make infrastructure building and careful expansion a (hopefully) viable alternative to fast expansion and allow smaller, well developed empires to compete with larger empires with empty systems and planets.

****************************************
*** Changes to Rising Stars Features ***
****************************************

[*] Game Options

- Added Automatically Claim Spatial Anomalies: When toggled on, spatial anomalies in your tradable area will automatically be claimed into your territory. Toggled off by default.
*** This adds the possibility to deactivate the script created by Dalo Lorn.

[*] Orbitals

- Subspace Telescope Array has been renamed to Quantum Telescope Array, has no maintenance cost anymore and can no longer move. Its Telescope ability now has a range of 1 million units and it now costs an amount of Energy and FTL Energy linearly relative to the target distance.

[*] Planets

- Level 6 planets now require 2 Level 1 resources (up from 0).

[*] Subsystems

- Removed the 90% maintenance cost reduction for Miner Hull. Extensive mining infrastructures should have a cost and in addition it made possible to maintain any unarmed unsupported flagship (like scouts or slipstream ships) basically for free.
- Re-added Muon Cannon and rebalanced it accordingly. Now renamed to Muon Projector.
- Muon Cannon Battery renamed to Muon Projector Battery.
- Re-added Carpet Bomb with supply cost doubled.
- Railgun Battery is now enhanced in the same way as support Railgun when Muon Projectors are researched (bonus to damage, accuracy and armor penetration).
- Fixed Support Shield Generators not being available after researching Shield Generator when not playing a technocracy government.

************************
*** Detailed Changes ***
************************

[*] Artifacts

- Renamed Arcology to Sky City.

[*] Artificial Intelligence

- AIs are now able to build and prioritize outposts to protect their territory or expand beyond systems without planets or resources (including nebulae). Evangelical lifestyles will build star temples instead.
- AIs now build moon bases on planets when needed (excepted, of course, Star Children).
- AIs will now slow down their colonization effort when necessary in order to maintain a budget buffer for other expenditures.
- AIs can now choose to prioritize one particular area with their budget under certain circumstances.
- AIs can now borrow money from their next budget for important construction projects.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where orbital types present in systems tracked by the AI were not loaded from a previous save.

[*] Attitudes

- Progressive Level 3 effect now grants four times as less research points to compensate for higher FTL Energy amounts spent overall.

[*] Buildings

*** All new buildings are available to non-Ancient and, obviously, non Star Children races only.

- Space Elevators now add 1 money generation per Planet Level starting from Level 1 if a Starport is present in the system and additionally cost 1k ore and 50 labor to build.
- Added Mining Complex. Adds an Ore resource that can be exported and generates 10 ore per minute at its destination. Also adds 2 labor pressure and increases the pressure given by native Aluminum, Iron, Titanium or Supercarbons by 2 and Coal or Native Gold by 1. Unlike the Ancient Strip Miner, ore stored on the planet is not moved on export. Base and maintenance costs of 190k and 120k, respectively. Also costs 50 research to build.
- Added Fuel Facility: Adds 1 energy pressure, 1 money pressure and increases the pressure given by native Natural Gas or Oil by 1. Base build and maintenance costs of 110 and 50k, respectively. Also costs 50 research to build.
- Added Electronics Factory: Can replace a Level 1 resource and adds 3 money pressure. Consumes 8 ore per minute. Base build and maintenance costs of 40k and 30k, respectively. The building becomes inactive if there is no more ore left on the planet (which can then potentially level down).
- Added Healthcare Complex: Adds 1 population and increases population growth by 10%. Base build and maintenance costs of 85k and 20k, respectively. Also costs 100 research to build and 100 more for each Healthcare Complex already built or building on the planet.
- Added Arcology: Adds 5 population and replaces 5 cities. Costs 2.5M, 2k ore, 20 influence, and 50 labor.

[*] FTL

*** FTL has been completely rebalanced with several objectives in mind. First: to make long distances matter more, especially in early game. Costs are balanced to make FTL a luxury at first and more common later, as more FTL sources and storage become available, but needs to be carefully planned and managed until very late game. Second: to take into account the possibility to research more FTL methods and even more clearly make
different methods preferable in different situations. Third: To tone down the advantages over sublight, while still retaining a clear advantage.

- Increased hyperdrive speed by a factor of 20. Hyperdrive speed ratio is identical to vanilla to make up for its decreased effectiveness over very long distances. Cost is unchanged, meaning it costs more FTL Energy to get from system A to system B.
- Increased fling beacon range by a factor of 4 and fling cost by a factor of 2. Fling cost is increased to make up for its increasing effectiveness the longer the distance is (travel time is constant, meaning that speed increases with distance). The range of beacons is reduced compared to vanilla.
- Increased slipstream cost by a factor of 1.4, optimal range by a factor of 5 and inaccuracy by a factor of 10. Effects of inaccuracy now start only beyond optimal range. Opening a slipstream to a very distant location will require either a ship-sized generator or a lot of FTL Energy. Opening it around the intended location and not 3 systems away will require a big ship.
- Increased jump drive range by a factor of 10. Jump drive is still the fastest and cheapest, but the safe range is half of vanilla.
- Increased gate maintenance cost to 0.25 FTL/s. More gates are needed to get a good territory coverage, and juggling with gate activation and deactivation is an absolute must.

[*] Game Options

- Added Quick Start: when toggled on, empires will be able to expand to other systems almost immediately instead of having to build a basic economy first. This reverts the now slower game start to more or less vanilla speed. This option is off by default.
- Added Supermassive Black Holes: when toggled on, black holes at the center of galaxies are supermassive and thus much bigger. Much. BIGGER. (And make an equally bigger boom.)
- Reduced the minimum and maximum values of the System Size slider to prevent systems that are too small or too large colliding each other. Added a tooltip warning to deactivate the Supermassive Black Holes option when reducing size (the size of this system is enforced and doesn't play well with reduced size).
- Disable Starting Fleets is now on by default.
- Default asteroid and orbital labor cost step increased to 100% (up from 50%).

[*] Lifestyles

- Somewhat flattened the Extragalactic free colonizer frequency exponential curve with a nerf hammer. Early game frequency is unchanged.

[*] Orbitals

- Commerce Stations now additionally cost 5 influence and provide income, for each friendly planet in the system excluding the owner's, equal to 100k per planet Level starting from 1 and up to 300k. Only one Commerce Station may now be built per system.
- Added Starport. Provides 25k income for each owned and friendly planet in the system, up to 75k. Support ships assigned to a Starport independently move across the system to attack enemy fleets. Can be upgraded to allow global resource trade. Only one Starport may be constructed per system.
- Added Telescope Array, which has 40% Telescope power of the quantum version. Costs 200k to build, requires no ore but has a 40k maintenance cost. Primarily designed for early scouting, when interstellar travel is a problem, and border control. Its Telescope ability only costs Energy (and no FTL Energy).
- Added Staging Hub. Allows trade through its system. Can import and sell resources and store cargo. Planets can be ordered to export their labor to this orbital, which can only build asteroid bases. Also has a small support capacity and gives 15 Defense Reserve when in orbit around a planet. Designed to fill various support roles, notably
for use as a remote mining base, as the new balance makes tractoring ore asteroids around a pain. Build and maintenance costs of 400k and 70k, respectively.
- Added Zero-G Lab. Gives 1 research generation and allows access to special projects. Build and maintenance costs of 400k and 100k, respectively.
- Added Hyperfield Harvester. Generates 0.15 FTL Energy per second and stores 250 FTL Energy. Build and maintenance costs of 450k and 75k, respectively.
- Added Tachyon Uplink. Unlocks the Tachyon Sensor subsystem. Requires 0.5 FTL maintenance. Can only be built in a Tachyon Nebula. Only one Tachyon Uplink may be constructed per system.
- FTL Storage orbitals for Star Children with Flux FTL now generate 0.5 FTL Energy per second and store 600 FTL Energy to make up for the impossibility to build FTL Breeders. They also additionally cost 500 ore to build.
- All orbitals now have a base sensor range of 10.000 units which can be upgraded through research.

[*] Planets

- Added gas giants, using previously unused vanilla low resolution textures. Gas giants can be colonized (more or less) and feature a new scalable resource designed to balance the increased scale of the game by providing increased propulsion speed and various pressure boosts. They are commonly found in all kinds of
systems, but they are more difficult to level up due to their mostly useless biome: imperial buildings cannot be built on it and civilian tile development is extremely slow. They however have a large number of moons where bases can be constructed. Gas giants completely bypass resource scarcity and planet
frequency options on purpose.
- Fixed a vanilla bug with asteroid fields orbiting Local Asteroid Field Planets not being rendered in certain circumstances.
- Local Asteroid Field planets now have more and bigger asteroids orbiting closer to them (this is a purely cosmetic change).
- Destroyed planets now yield more asteroid with less ore.
- Planets now have a base sensor range of 20.000 units which can be upgraded through research.
- Slightly reduced pressure capacity of planets per level.
- Reduced population growth by approximately 20%.
- Added a new Project exclusive to planets, Planet Exploration. Sends an exploration team around the planet. May yield a random discovery. This feature is similar to how anomalies work, with smaller bonuses, but available a (limited) number of times per planet. Homeworlds have a special set of (more beneficial) anomalies.

[*] Research

- Orbital Command and Orbital Command 2 now also grant 64 and 128 additional support capacity, respectively, to Starports.
- Added 8 Sensors and 1 Sensors 2 node. Increases all sensor ranges by 10% and 20%, respectively.

[*] Resources

- Welfare option base threshold is now 200k (down from 350k).
- Guaranteed resources on planets in systems adjacent to starting systems can now spawn farther in the neighborhood to counterbalance the addition of nebulae and planetless systems, which can deadlock the distribution.
- Added FTL Crystals asteroids: provide 1 FTL/s and add 250 FTL storage. These are not consumed when mined (but they can be captured...). Spawn frequency is slightly lower than FTL shards.
- FTL Shards asteroids now permanently add 500 FTL storage (up from 100).
- FTL Crystals planets now provide 0.5/1/1.5/2/3/5/10 FTL/s.
- Added Rare Gases, a new scalable resource found on gas giants only. Increases all ship engine thrust (including colony ships) by a cumulative bonus of 0%/5%/15%/30%/60%/100%/175%. Does not increase turn rate nor hyperdrive speed. Gains 2 Energy pressure per level starting from level 1, 2 Defense pressure per level starting from level 2, 2 Research pressure per level starting from level 3, 2 Influence pressure per level starting from level 4 and 2 Money pressure per level starting from level 5. Cannot be exported.
*** Sublight species are strongly advised to heavily invest in developing those planets!
- Available ore on asteroids has been reduced to anywhere from 50 to 1250 ore (down from 500 to 10000). Default ore asteroid chance per system has been changed to 90% (up from 45%). In addition, systems with ore asteroids are very likely to have a LOT of them.
- Moderately increased resource asteroid chance. Slightly decreased Construction Materials and Morphic Materials asteroid chance. Moderately decreased FTL Shards asteroid chance.
- Added a 5% chance for systems to have one or more asteroid belts. These have a chance to contain resource asteroids equal to 1/30th of the resource asteroid chance.
- Black holes now have a big, thick asteroid belt beyond their accretion disk.
- Increased default resource asteroid chance to 60% (up from 45%).
- Renamed Electronics resource to Semiconductors.
- Deuterium and Neutronium can now very rarely spawn as an asteroid resource.
- Comets and Protoplanets now have a low chance of spawning in systems regardless of the artifact frequency option.
- Empires no longer start with any FTL generation or FTL storage regardless of FTL trait choice.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL Crystals asteroid in their home system. A mine is prebuilt if the Quick Start game option is toggled on. This effectively reverts the starting FTL generation and FTL storage to vanilla values.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Pekelm asteroid in an adjacent system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Explosives asteroid in an adjacent system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL Crystals asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Neutronium asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have 6k worth of ore asteroids in their home system instead of one 6k ore asteroid.
- Empires now have an additional anomaly in their home system.
- Empires now have an additional Comet in their home system.
- Empires now have one less Water planet in adjacent systems.
- Empires now have an additional Food planet in their home system, but one less in adjacent systems.

[*] Subsystems

*** Sensors from ABEM have been reimplemented with a completely different approach. All flagship and station hulls now have integrated basic sensors. Sight range is moderate, slightly scaled with size and can be upgraded through research.
Specific sensor subsystems can be added to flagship	and station designs to further enhance sight range but their design is now focused on handling high costs rather than competing with armor.
- Added Sensor Dish. Increases sight range by a small amount. Adding more than one dish doesn't increase sight range more and only gives redundancy benefits.
- Added Phasing Sensor. Increases sight range by a moderate amount, decreasing as the subsystem's size increases. Requires Power. Requires increasingly high amounts of Power and Control as the subsystem's size increases. Sinew halves the Control requirements.
- Added Tachyon Sensor back. Increases sight range by a high amount, decreasing as the subsystem's size increases. Requires an active Tachyon Uplink orbital to function. Requires increasingly high amounts of Control as the subsystem's size increases. Sinew halves the Control requirements.
- Increased most weapon ranges by a factor of 2. Energy Bomb, Plasma Thrower, Pulse Bolt and Subspace Shredder ranges are unchanged. The Flak Battery range formula has been tweaked to keep a much more linear and slow progression relative to ship size.
- Increased Fleet Computer raiding range bonus (and base raiding range) by a factor of 3.

[*] Systems

*** The increased scale of gas sprites strongly impacts system performances when playing with lots of stars and / or nebulae. Consider turning galaxy gas off if you experience stuttering.
- Increased scale of stars by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planets by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planet gravity wells by a factor relative to its planet's 'mass'.
- Increased scale of ringworld gravity wells to their system's radius to simulate them having no gravity well (they have no core), but instead objects actually orbiting around the star. As a side effect, orbitals restricted to planet gravity well can be built anywhere in the system, which seems completely reasonable for ringworlds.
- Increased scale of asteroids by a factor of 2.
- Decreased scale of ships by a factor of 0.5.
- Increased default system spacing by a factor of 20. System spacing can no longer be reduced below the default value.
- Increased variance in vertical spacing of systems in the core of spiral galaxies.
- Increased variance in planet number per system, possibly down to 0. Planetless systems have a greatly increased chance of hiding valuable asteroids and artifacts.
- Black holes in the core of spiral and cluster galaxies are now supermassive if the Supermassive Black Holes game option is toggled on.
*** The massive scale of the supermassive black holes accretion disks slightly impacts system performances. Consider turning this option off if you experience stuttering.
- The guaranteed moon around the level 1 planet in the home system has moved to the homeworld.

[*] User Interface

- Reduced Ore Asteroid strategic icon size by a factor of 3 so their sheer number does not disturb strategic icon system display when zoomed out.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where the dry dock construction menu would list different versions of a design under certain circumstances.

[*] Known issues

- Regular planets (including homeworlds) will rarely have a gas giant atmosphere.
