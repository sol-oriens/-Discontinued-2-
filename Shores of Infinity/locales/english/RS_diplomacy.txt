CLAUSE_GATESHARE: Gate Access
CLAUSE_GATESHARE_DESC: <<
	Empires that have signed this treaty allow mutual access to their stargates and synchronize their gate networks, essentially forming a larger network.

	While part of this treaty, your ships can pass through other signatories' stargates as if they were your own.
