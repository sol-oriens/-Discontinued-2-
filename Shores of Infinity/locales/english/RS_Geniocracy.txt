	Increases the maximum population of planets depending on their level and this technology's current tech level:

	Level 0 - No change regardless of tech level.
	Level 1 - Increases population limit by 1 every 8 levels.
	Level 2 - Increases population limit by 1 every 4 levels.
	Level 3 - Increases population limit by 1 every 3 levels.

GENIOCRACY_SHIELDUPGRADE: Subspace Deflectors
GENIOCRACY_SHIELDUPGRADE_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]New developments into shield technology allow us to shunt enemy weapons fire into subspace where they can't harm us. Unfortunately, the technology is currently incompatible with conventional plasma shields, and requires a great amount of power. More problematically, some incompetent lab tech managed to purge the database of any trace of plasma shield technology, so we'll have to develop it all over again.[/i][/color]

	Doubles the power consumption of all shields, and increases their capacity and regeneration by $2 and $1, respectively.
