OUTPOST_ARMORING: Structural Enhancement
OUTPOST_ARMORING_DESC: <<
	Reinforce the orbital's frame and outer hull, allowing it to withstand more damage before critical failure.

	Adds 10000 health and 5000 armor. May be modified by upgrades that improve orbital health. Subsequent structural enhancement requires increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_DEFENSE: Refit Launch Bays
OUTPOST_DEFENSE_DESC: <<
	Perform a substantial retrofit of the orbital's hangar deck and docking ports, allowing it to support more vessels coming in or out at any given time. The additional traffic also encourages the civilian sector to assist with constructing additional defense ships.

	Adds 256 support capacity and 4 Defense generation. Subsequent hangar refits require increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_WEAPONS: Install Swarm Missiles
OUTPOST_WEAPONS_DESC: <<
	Install a swarm missile launcher on the orbital's exterior, improving its ability to hold off raiders or interrupt enemy trade.

	Adds 10 missile tubes, each firing one missile per second for a damage of 50 per missile. May be modified by upgrades that improve stationary defense weapons. Subsequent missile launchers require increasingly large amounts of Ore to install.

RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCHARGER: Hypercharger
RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCHARGER_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]A canon projecting a constant beam of energy extracted from a hypercore, able to tremendously boost engine thrust for a short duration. This effect is nicknamed "hypersail", though there is no physical sail per se.[/i][/color]

	Unlocks the Hypercharge Project.

RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCORE: Hyperfield Collision
RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCORE_DESC: <<

RESEARCH_LAB_FTL: Hyperfield Crystallization
RESEARCH_LAB_FTL_DESC: <<

STAGING_HUB_ASTEROID_MORPH: Core Mining
STAGING_HUB_ASTEROID_MORPH_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]It's no secret that asteroids usually are far richer in resources than planets. Unfortunately, the benefits of drilling deep enough to get access to their hidden treasures are as massive as the cost of setting a space-based infrastructure up to do so.[/i][/color]

STARPORT_DOCKING_BAYS: Long Haul Docking Bays
STARPORT_DOCKING_BAYS_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Standard civilian trade ships are not suited for very long distance travels and an extensive infrastructure is required to maintain supply lines across multiple systems. These much bigger and specialized docking bays allow long distance superhaulers to dock at the starport, a privilege usually exclusive to huge commerce stations.[/i][/color]

	Allows global resource trade between any territories with Commerce Stations or Starports with Long Haul Docking Bays.
