CAMPAIGN_MONO: Mono Collective - Unit-00 (Tutorial)
CAMPAIGN_MONO_DESC: <<
	Sometime around 30000-5000 BP, the artificial construct now known as 'Mono Unit-00' malfunctioned and crashed on the remote world of Arith Prime. Unable to determine where it came from, how it came here, or what it was meant to do, it began building duplicates of itself to help in its search for a Creator... or a Purpose to execute.

	This is the story of how its creations, the Mono, became a small spacefaring empire from a battered husk in an impact crater. This is the story of the beginnings of the Mono Collective.

MONO1_INTRO_TEXT: <<
	It has been forty-two years since Unit-00 crashed on Arith Prime.
	
	Home to the colony designated 'Node-00', Arith Prime houses an increasingly large quantity of Mono drones, but their technology is still fairly rudimentary, and limited mostly to the blueprints derived from Unit-00.
	
	Before the Mono can continue their quest for the Creator, they must first build a more industrialized society...
