ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER: Power Transmitter
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_BLURB: Recharges the shields of allied fleets in the system.
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<

ORB_GUARDIAN: Guardian Facility
ORB_GUARDIAN_BLURB: Acts as a Research-generating super-shipyard, or constructs a powerful Guardian.
ORB_GUARDIAN_DESC: <<
	An ancient shipyard of tremendous scale used to construct Guardians, the so-called 'Guardian Facility' is as valuable as the knowledge on the nearby Hubworld.

	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.

ORB_EMBASSY: Embassy
ORB_EMBASSY_BLURB: Sends envoys to other planets to achieve diplomatic goals.
ORB_EMBASSY_DESC: <<
	A center of diplomatic activity, this station periodically sends out Envoys to other planets. Envoys persuade the governments of enemy planets that they would be better off under their empire's rule, and inspire the populations of allied planets into persisting long after they would normally be beaten.

	Enemy planets visited by an Envoy have a 10% chance of defecting to your empire. Planets belonging to your empire, your vassals or an empire you have an Alliance with will be immune to loyalty loss for 180 seconds.

	Diplomatic backlash gives you and your allies Leverage against anyone who would destroy the Embassy.

	High levels of diplomatic activity in the Embassy grant 2 Influence Stake, and a 5% chance of receiving a random influence card every minute.

	Embassies act as Commerce Stations and Outposts in that they allow trade between separated territories, and expand your empire's borders, respectively.
