ORB_TRADE_OUTPOST_BLURB: Allows trade through its system. Generates defense ships and protects planets in the system from being captured. Can store 1k units of cargo.
ORB_TRADE_OUTPOST_DESC: <<|
	A small outpost that allows your civilian ships to travel through the
	system it is in.

	Outposts generate up to [b]3 Defense[/b] worth of local defense ships,
	depending on how many adjacent systems have outposts in them.

	If all of the outpost's support command is used and it has a full
	complement of defense ships, it will start adding its defense generation to
	your empire's global pool.

	Planets in systems that have contained an outpost for at least 2 minutes
	will be [b]Protected[/b] from being captured until the outpost is destroyed.

	[i]Can be built in systems you do not own planets in, expanding your
	empire border. Only one outpost can be constructed per system.[/i]

	Can store 1k units of cargo.

	at peace with, to each friendly empire including yours, equal to 100k per
	planet Level starting from 1 and up to 300k.

	In addition, on each commerce station you can purchase a quantity of
	research, energy, influence or labor in exchange for money every 3 minutes.

	[i]Normally, planets in separated territories cannot export resources to
	each other. Construct a commerce station or upgrade a starport with long haul
	docking bays in both territories in order to allow import and export of
	resources from planets in your distinct territories. Only one commerce

ORB_GUARDIAN: Guardian Facility
ORB_GUARDIAN_BLURB: Acts as a Research-generating super-shipyard, or constructs a powerful Guardian.
ORB_GUARDIAN_DESC: <<
	An ancient shipyard of tremendous scale used to construct Guardians, the so-called 'Guardian Facility' is as valuable as the knowledge on the nearby Hubworld.

	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.
