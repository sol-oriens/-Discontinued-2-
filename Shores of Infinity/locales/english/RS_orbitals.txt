ORB_TRADE_STATION_DESC: <<|
	A large and bustling station of commerce allows global resource trade
	between any territories with commerce stations or starports with long haul
	docking bays. Additional trade with foreign empires also provides
	income, for each planet in the system belonging to another empire you are
	at peace with to each friendly empire including yours, equal to 100k per
	planet Level starting from 1 and up to 300k.

	In addition, on each commerce station you can purchase a quantity of
	research, energy, influence or labor in exchange for money every 3 minutes.

	[i]Normally, planets in separated territories cannot export resources to
	each other. Construct a commerce station or upgrade a starport with long haul
	docking bays in both territories in order to allow import and export of
	resources from planets in your distinct territories. Only one commerce
	station can be constructed per system.[/i]

ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER: Power Transmitter
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_BLURB: Recharges the shields of allied fleets in the system.
ORB_SHIELD_CHARGER_DESC: <<
	A series of powerful generators and emitters transmits additional power to any ships in need of it. This power is then harnessed to charge up the ships' shield capacitors. However, shield activity disrupts the transmission beam, so combat will prevent continued charging.

	Increases the out-of-combat shield recharge rate of all ships in the system by 25, plus 0.01% of the ships' shield capacity.

>>
ORB_GUARDIAN: Guardian Facility
ORB_GUARDIAN_BLURB: Acts as a Research-generating super-shipyard, or constructs a powerful Guardian.
ORB_GUARDIAN_DESC: <<
	An ancient shipyard of tremendous scale used to construct Guardians, the so-called 'Guardian Facility' is as valuable as the knowledge on the nearby Hubworld.

	The advanced nature of the facility's matter fabricators and the phase shifting it uses to store finished components produce an immense quantity of Research. The technology itself allows the facility to construct anything as if it were a planet, import Labor from other planets, generate 100 Labor per minute and store 5000 Labor. It cannot, however, be used to export Labor to other shipyards.

	The sheer size of the facility makes it impossible to move through conventional means, while its phasing technology causes complications when attempting to use FTL systems to propel it. Additionally, automated security systems of considerable complexity prevent boarding parties from making any progress while attacking it.

	If damaged severely enough, the Guardian Facility will shut down and phase-shift; while its location is no longer a mystery, it will have to be reactivated and repaired again.

ORB_EMBASSY_BLURB: Sends envoys to other planets to achieve diplomatic goals.
ORB_EMBASSY_DESC: <<
	A center of diplomatic activity, this station periodically sends out Envoys to other planets. Envoys persuade the governments of enemy planets that they would be better off under their empire's rule, and inspire the populations of allied planets into persisting long after they would normally be beaten.

	Enemy planets visited by an Envoy have a 10% chance of defecting to your empire. Planets belonging to your empire, your vassals or an empire you have an Alliance with will be immune to loyalty loss for 180 seconds.

	Diplomatic backlash gives you and your allies Leverage against anyone who would destroy the Embassy.

	High levels of diplomatic activity in the Embassy grant 2 Influence Stake, and a 5% chance of receiving a random influence card every minute.

	Embassies act as Commerce Stations and Outposts in that they allow trade between separated territories, and expand your empire's borders, respectively.
